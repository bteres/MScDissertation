abstract = {A lightning waveform is usually defined by the rise time tf, pulse length tp and peak value I. In order to represent lightning current waveforms in an analytic manner, the double-exponential formula is employed to fit with the lightning current waveforms. This paper describes the relationship between the waveform parameters tf, tp, I and the formula constants $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and A. An effective algorithm is proposed to calculate $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and A. The algorithm gives a reasonable expression for $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and A from the data points of lightning current waveforms. Numerical examples are derived from the algorithm for a few types of lightning current waveforms that are commonly used in lightning protection design. A better agreement appears between calculated and standard waveforms.},

In order to study the influence of tall towers on lightning current measurement, the transmission line (TL) model of the lightning return stroke was applied to calculate the lightning current at different positions of the tower. This paper also analyzed the factors which influence the results of lightning current measurement on tall towers. Simulation result shows that the current obtained at the top of the tower is most close to the real lightning current, and the amplitude of lightning current is influenced by a few factors, such as the height of the tower, the reflectance of the ground and the rise-time of the lightning current waveform. However, the lightning current waveforms measured at different positions of low towers are almost the same.},

We give sets of constants for these expressions such that the resultant waveforms for positive and negative flashes and for their component strokes and continuing current exhibit ap- proximately the median and severe lightning current parameters recommended, and otherwise resemble the measured waveforms found in the literature.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {The current model of the lightning process is established and simulated in this article, and aiming at the disadvantage that the hardware filtering de-noising method adopted in the general lightning measurement system can not effectively separate signals and noises in same one frequency channel, this article uses the wavelet transform to replace the usual hardware filtering method in the lightning measurement system in order to overcome the disadvantage, and simulate this method. The result shows that this method is feasible and effective, with certain theoretical and practical values.},
