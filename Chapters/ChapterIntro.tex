Mathematical lightning current models are used in many areas of research ranging from the design of lightning protection systems to the understanding of electric and magnetic fields associated with lightning discharges \cite{IEC623051, ZhangFeizhouandLiuShanghe2002}.
Lightning current models are typically used as design tools and for further research into the understanding of the effects of a lightning strike.
They have become an integral part of lightning research and \gls{lps} design.
This research provides an approximation to the Heidler function that can be integrated. This allows for an accurate frequency domain representation of the function. Furthermore, the electromagnetic fields can be calculated using Maxwell's equations analytically.

An equation is designed to approximate the Heidler function. The function is as ``customisable'' as the Heidler function (i.e. any lightning current waveshape can be obtained with varying characteristics).
An investigation is carried out to determine the accuracy of the approximation. This is done by using computer simulations of the approximation and the results are compared to the Heidler function and the IEC~62305 lightning protection standard to determine the viability of this approximation in the design of LPSs.

\chapref{ChapterApproach} details the \textbf{\textit{approach taken}} in designing and evaluating the approximation to the Heidler function. The assumptions and constraints made in this study are outlined. The significance of this study in the field of lightning research is discussed with reference to the problem statements.

\chapref{ChapterBackground} discusses the relevant \textbf{\textit{background}} information with respect to this research. This includes information about the Heidler function and the \gls{lemp} equations. A review of the existing work in the field of approximating lightning currents is also identified.

\chapref{ChapterApprox} provides the actual \textbf{\textit{approximation to the Heidler function}}. All the components of the equation are discussed as well as the parameters used to create the various waveshapes. A comparison of the parameters used in the approximation and the Heidler function are given. Some results of the approximation are simulated and detailed in this chapter.

\chapref{ChapterResults} investigates the accuracy of the approximation by simulating \textbf{\textit{results}} and comparing them to the expected values obtained from the Heidler function. Furthermore the characteristics such as maximum instantaneous change in current, charge, etc. are compared to those outlined in the IEC~62305 standard.

\chapref{ChapterDiscussion} summarises the results obtained from the simulations. A \textbf{\textit{discussion}} of the viability of this approximation as a suitable replacement to the Heidler function is provided. \textbf{\textit{Future work}} in the field of approximating lightning current models is detailed with the goal of optimising the approximation detailed in this study.

\chapref{ChapterConclusion} provides a \textbf{\textit{conclusion}} to the work and discusses the viability of this function in various fields of lightning research.
